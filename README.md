# Upstox React Native assignment

React Native assignment for Upstox

## Points to note

- **Redux** - Although we could have done this task without the use of any global state management libraries, I have used Redux here to make the app more scalable, separation of concerns and better state management
- Have added _dark-mode / light-mode_ feature as an enhancement
- Have used the brand new, performant [Gorhom bottomsheet](https://ui.gorhom.dev/components/bottom-sheet/)
- Have used Shopify's [Flashlist](https://shopify.github.io/flash-list/) to make the UI more performant and super smooth
